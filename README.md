## Team Members: 

- Demarcus Wirsing
- Drishti Arora
- Nigist Woldeeyesus
- Sai Kumar Kanuru
- Yunpeng Li

## Project Goals:

- Train various machine learning models on clinic tabular data to predict and evaluate the results of skin lesion classifications.
- Use image processing techniques and construct various deep learning models on skin image data to evaluate the results of skin lesion classifications.
- Use skin cancer image data to inference missing clinic tabular column values through deep learning on image data. 
- Construct a deep leaning hybrid model that combines both image and tabular data to do skin lesion classifications.
- Prove or disapprove combining clinic tabular data and skin lesion image data in deep learning can achieve better accuracy score.
- Evaluate the accuracy and performance of various models in the end and find the best model for skin lesion classifications.

## Project Highlights
### Machine Learning

### Deep Learning

Hybrid Model architecture
<br>It connects one of the prebuilt CNN models (ResNet18, GoogleNet, MobileNet V2, DenseNet121) for processing image data and fully connected layers with Relu activation for processing tabular data.
