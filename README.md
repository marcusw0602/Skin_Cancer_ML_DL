## Project Goals:

- Train various machine learning models on clinic tabular data to predict and evaluate the results of skin lesion classifications.
- Use image processing techniques and construct various deep learning models on skin image data to evaluate the results of skin lesion classifications.
- Use skin cancer image data to inference missing clinic tabular column values through deep learning on image data. 
- Construct a deep leaning hybrid model that combines both image and tabular data to do skin lesion classifications.
- Prove or disapprove combining clinic tabular data and skin lesion image data in deep learning can achieve better accuracy score.
- Evaluate the accuracy and performance of various models in the end and find the best model for skin lesion classifications.

### Deep Learning

<ins>Column Inferencing</ins>
<p>The main purpose of column inference is to use deep learning models trained by image data to predict missing values in columns.  The main strategy is to treat a particular tabular column as a class label, and then train images in deep learning models to predict the value of that column.
<p>Both GoogleNet and DenseNet121 have relatively better overall performance on inferencing column values of our tabular data.  All results show the column biopsy has the highest inferencing scores, so it indicates column biopsy has strong correlation with skin lesion types.  A possible explanation is that a doctor may tend to order a skin biopsy when the patient is suspected to have skin cancer after viewing the patientâ€™s skin image.

<ins>Hybrid Model architecture</ins>
<p>It connects one of the prebuilt CNN models (ResNet18, GoogleNet, MobileNet V2, DenseNet121) for processing image data and fully connected layers with Relu activation for processing tabular data.
