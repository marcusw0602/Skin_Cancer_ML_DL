The skin_categories folder contains 6 subfolders for 6 different skin lesion types. The 6 subfolders are generated by python script (See Skin_Cancer_ML_DL/Skin_Cancer_Analysis/Deep_Learning/EDA/EDA_And_Image_Folder_Creation.ipynb).
They comply with the directory structure that Pytorchâ€™s torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder favors.
